- Information is stored in the Local Storage, there is a separate branch being worked with the Firebase BAAS.

## Technologies and Techniques used
### Planning and Design:
- The planning was done with the [User Story Mapping](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/agile-software-development/what-is-user-story-mapping/) technique.
- The web app architecture is Layared, you can find the [Package Diagram here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PuHGRuayaBVpBX9sLB-SgivhDx4Xd1Sl/view).
- The Class Diagram designed for this web app is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WIJ_nVVN-KQALMpElAHlSivR7jujEkLV/view?usp=sharing).
- The UI was implemented matching the [todoist.com](https://todoist.com/) UI shapes and colors from scratch:

### Front-end:
- Vanilla Javascript.
- Internal application state managed 100% with [Clousures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures).
- CSS design with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). 
- The web app is 100% responsive.

### Back-end:
- This web app has no backend for now. 
- Due to the type of information is handled, all the information is stored in the [Local Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).

### Testing:
- Manual Testing was done with ~80% coverage.
- While testing, the project was run using the Chrome's Development Tools "Fast 3G" and "No Caching" options. So the app is ready for slow internet connections.

## Room for Improvement
There are always room for improvement, in this project so far the thinkgs that can be improved are:

- Implement automated Unit Testing.
- Migrate to a Javascript framework in order to increase the maintainability for future changes.
